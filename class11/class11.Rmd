Q1: What proportion of PDB entries does X-ray crystallography account for? What proportion of
structures are protein?
```{r}
#import our PDB statistics CSV file and calculate percent structures by experimental method
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
#Calculate and assign numbers with a category
percent <- (pdbstats$Total / sum(pdbstats$Total))*100
names(percent) <- row.names(pdbstats)
percent


```
